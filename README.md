## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
- No outside source was used.


2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
- One of the few challenges I encountered when working on this project was understanding the musical function of setting the tone of the game. Although, technically I did not run into any issues or bugs, I was only confused how the function was being processed but after reviewing and tweaking the function I was able to better understand how the function works. This was a great function to understand because it helped me to better understand other functions from a greater scale. The play sequence function was also another function which at first seems intimidating but after working with Java in the past and reviewing the tone function I was prepared to understand the loop the function passes. Lastly, the guess function was another function which was a learning curve which became beneficial due to attempting my own function and comparing it to the funciton provided. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- After completing my submission I am curious about the backend of web developement. For example, how may a site store the time it took for the user to complete the game while ranking among other players online. This is an idea that has come to mind which allows the game to be played on a greater scale and creates a competitive astmosphere. I have always been curious within the backend of web developement and how it affects the building of the website. It seems as if the backend is the mind of the site which stores the data.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- I would add multiple levels which will differ in difficulty, this will help the user's ease into the game and become comfortable with the mechanics and the ideas within the game. This will also lead the team to creating an online competitive match-making which users can compete for the faster time taken to complete the sounds given. This is an idea that will also hold a ranking system which will allow users to become more driven within the application while also increasing the completiveness within players which leads to a more enjoyable application, from the simple idea that users enjoy a competitive feature.
